>> More? [ynq] 

Just be careful there - there is only 1 Vector object, so saying that
"foo" is added to all 3 vectors is misleading.  You make new objects
with the new operator. Creating copies of references does not make new
objects.  Think of the new operator as making you a new Television,
and when you pass references around, it's like having multiple remote
controls.  Here's an example;
public class Bob
{
	TV bobsRemote = new TV(); //1 TV object now exists on the heap
	public Bob()
	{
		new Tim(bobsRemote);
	}
}

public class Tim
{

	public Tim(TV timsRemote)
	{
		//now tim has his own remote, but they both control Bob's TV
		timsRemote.setChannel("Playboy");
		//now both Bob and Tim are aroused

		timsRemote = new TV();//now 2 TVs are on the heap
		//Tim just bought a new TV and reprogrammed his
		//universal TV remote control
		//Bob is still aroused
		timsRemote.setChannel("CNN");
		//now Tim is learning about Anthrax
		//Bob is still aroused
	}
}
