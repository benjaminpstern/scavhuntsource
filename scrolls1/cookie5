[Chuck:]announcing...the return of rhys (the machine) (actually its
chris (the machine) because rhys is still in the shop but chris thinks
it is rhys).  Thus, high speed downloading and sparcstation binaries,
audio, and whatever else people are ga-ga over at the moment is available
once again...
[Rhys:]announcing...the return of rhys (the human) (actually its chris
(the machine) because rhys is still in the shop but chris thinks it is
rhys).
I think chuck (the human)'s message was perfectly clear, but in case
anyone (a human) is confused, I (the machine) thought it (the human)
should e-mail you (the humans) from the shop where chris thinks it is
rhys to simplify chuck's (the machine's) obfuscations.  chris (the
machine) does not in fact believe it is rhys (the human) but is only
saying this to try to persuade rich (the human) that it is, in fact,
bob (the machine as opposed to yogi (the bear)).  According to alan
(the human) this will prove that it (the machine) is intelligent.

For those of you who wonder why fritz does not figure in this
explanation, it's because it's a macintosh (which only thinks it's a
machine).
