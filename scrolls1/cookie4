(in compilers we are looking at a blackboard from a philosophy
class with what looks like a linked list of famous names 
such as newton, einstein ... and linker (?))

"Who is linker" sez karl
"He must be some famous philosophist" sez jen
(bob & karl give jen a _look_)
jen tries again: "falafel?"
karl suggests: "Ah, yes, Philosophy is the study of
		falafel and Linguistics is the study of linguini!"
"Philosophizer?" asks jen, hoping this one is right.
"Great linguists of pasta and present" adds karl.
